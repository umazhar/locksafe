
#  A Simple Password Manager

## About the Project
This application is a simple password manager that allows the user to
 - Add/remove accounts
 - Generate new passwords

Each account has a *website, username, email and password* associated with it. To access the password
manager, you would need to enter the correct password. From there, you can view/edit your saved accounts
and their associated passwords. You can sort accounts into folders such as *"social media"* or *"school"*.
Additionally, there is a password generator which allows the user to generate secure passwords compromised of randomized characters.
